    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "(example) We are building a web application with API access to a machine learning model without giving source of code or any details how it works. We are interested in building a high quality text classifier that categorizes new stories into 2 categories - information and entertainment. We want the classifier to stick with predicting the better among these two categories (this classifier will not predict a percentage score for these two categories).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methodology\n",
    "(describe the steps)\n",
    "There are 10000 different news stories and additional news stories.\n",
    "- Run the classifier on 1 mln random stories out of 1000 news sources. Get 10k stories where the classifier output is the closest to the decision boundary and get these examples labeled.\n",
    "- Get 10k random labeled stories from the 10k random labeled stories from 1000 news we care about.\n",
    "- Pick a random sample of 1 mln stories from 1000 news sources and have them labeled. Pick the subset of 10k stories where the modelâ€™s output is both wrong and farthest away from the decision boundary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using different methods of classifying a bag of news articles from 1000 news sources, measure the accuracy of the model with an original train dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Business Segments\n",
    "(advise for which business segments you can apply the model)\n",
    "Business Segments are the following, please following the names of business segments given:\n",
